# About Me Page Assignment

This repository contains my implementation of an about me page, featuring ALTSchool's signin and signup pages. This project was created as part of my ALTSchool first semester assignment. The goal was to showcase proficiency in front-end development, with a specific focus on designing a user-friendly and visually appealing checkout experience.

## Assignment Overview

### Implementation Details
I designed and coded an about me, sign in and sign up page respectively using HTML and Sass. For this project, I opted to experiment with Sass for the first time, aiming to explore its features and capabilities. This choice opens up new possibilities for more efficient and maintainable stylesheets through the use of Sass's powerful features, such as variables, mixins, and nested rules. The goal was to leverage Sass's advantages to streamline the styling process and contribute to a more organized and scalable codebase for the project.

### Technologies Used
- **HTML:** Utilized for structuring the content and layout of the checkout page.
- **Sass:** Applied for styling and enhancing the visual presentation of the page. Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS.
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented through media queries to ensure optimal viewing on different devices.

## Repository Structure

- **`index.html`:** The main HTML file containing the structure of the responsive checkout page.
- **`styles.css`:** The CSS file with styles for enhancing the visual appeal.
- **`assets/`:** Directory for storing any images or icons used in the project.
