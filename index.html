      <h1>About My ALTSchool Journey</h1>
      <h2>Why I joined ALTSchool</h2>
      <p>
        I picked the ALTSchool (SOE) application primarily because I read the
        testimonies of the first cohort (session) graduates on X (twitter).
        Reading their experiences made me aspire to join the application
        waitlist. The second most important reason is my desire to build a creer
        as a full-stack developer.
        <br />
        Considering my experience thus far, I can confidently say that, they
        know their onions.
      </p>
      <h2>What I plan to achieve with ALTSchool</h2>
      <p>
        My dream career is to sit infront of a computer and change the world one
        line of code at a time. I yearn to birth my innovative and creative
        ideas with the power of technology, while remedying peoples problems
        with the engineering skills I've garnered. <br /><br />
        From an aspiring young dev to the possibilities that awaits, this is me
        saying to the world... <br />
        <span> console.log('Hello World!')</span>
